# Affiliate-payouts
*****
****
## Project Description
A solution for On-click global Payouts for Affiliates and Influencers in any country. Enables Businesses to grow their sales and traction by signing up Influencers and Affiliates and paying them out.
******

## Idea
Develop a platform that facilitates on-click global payouts for affiliates and influencers in various countries.
The platform will enable businesses to incentivize their affiliates by offering quick and efficient payouts through Chimoney's API. Affiliates will have the ability to request payouts, and businesses can easily process these payments using the API.
This system will enhance user experiences and foster stronger partnerships between businesses and affiliates.

## Example Implementation
For instance, an affiliate on the platform requests a payout of $100. The business admin receives a notification and approves the request. The platform uses Chimoney's API to initiate the payout process, securely transferring the funds to the affiliate's preferred payment method.
